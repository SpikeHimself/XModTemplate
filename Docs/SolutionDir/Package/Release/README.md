# XModTemplate

XModTemplate serves as a template for new mods. It does nothing.

This README was generated using T4 Text Templating, and will contain invalid URLs until someone uses XModTemplate and updates the information in `XModTemplate\ModInfo.cs`.

# Features

#### Nothing

This mod does nothing. It exists only to make life easy.

#### Copy me

You can clone this mod and rename it. Just don't forget to find all occurances of "XModTemplate" and change them.

Pro tip: Open the project in Visual Studio, right-click the namespace in one of the code files, and choose `Rename`. You'll still have to rename some files, though!


# Installation instructions

There is no point installing this mod. It does nothing. The text below only serves as an example.

XModTemplate is a [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) plugin. As such, you must have BepInEx installed. Most other Valheim mods are also BepInEx plugins, so chances are you already have this.

XModTemplate makes use of the [Jotunn](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/Jotunn/) library, so you must install that before installing XModTemplate. If you do not install Jotunn, XModTemplate will simply not be loaded by your game and it will not work.

I very strongly recommend using a mod manager such as [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1) or [r2modman](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/). They will take care of everything for you and you don't have to worry about which files go where. I recommend against manual installation.
1. Make sure you have [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) installed.
2. Install [Jotunn](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/Jotunn/).
3. On [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/-1) click 'Mod manager download', or on [Thunderstore](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/SpikeHimself/XModTemplate/) click 'Install with Mod Manager'.

# I did more too!

Please have a look at my other mods too! 

[XPortal](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/SpikeHimself/XPortal/) lets you select a portal destination from a list of existing portals, so that you don't have to match portal tags anymore.

[XStorage](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/SpikeHimself/XStorage/) lets you open multiple chests at once, rename them, and move items/stacks to the most suitable chest.
